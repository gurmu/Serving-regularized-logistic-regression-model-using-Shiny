# Serving-regularized-logistic-regression-model-using-Shiny

Torturing data with Regularization parameter will reduce its generalization error but not its training error which develops train models that generalize better on unseen data, by preventing the algorithm from overfitting the training dataset. In this lesson, we will refer the saved model and build a shiny app and test the app by uploading test data.
